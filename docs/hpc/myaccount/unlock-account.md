# Your Account Has Been Locked

## What happened and why?

If you are reading this, **your Wynton account has been locked**. This
can happen for several reasons:

1. **Your password has expired**
   - _Passwords must be updated at least every 12 months_ per
    University of California requirements. Wynton sends out automatic
    email notifications reminding any user that their password is
    about to expire. These email messages are sent each Sunday
    starting two weeks before a password expires[^1]. To avoid this
    from happening again, please make sure to update your password at
    least every 12 months. If you cannot remember when you last
    changed it, you can always [change your
    password](../howto/change-pwd.html) at any time.

2. **Your UCSF affiliation has expired**
   - When leaving the UCSF, your UCSF affiliation expires and your
    account is locked. At times, this can happen also when you
    transition from one UCSF position to another.

3. **Your Wynton guest account has expired**
   - If you are not a UCSF affiliate, but have a Wynton account that
    was sponsored by a UCSF collaborator, then your UCSF sponsor needs
    to renew this every 12 months.



## Instructions for unlocking your account

If the only reason your account was locked was because of a
recently expired password (less than 30 days ago), you can
reset it by sending email to [wynton-password@ucsf.edu](mailto:wynton-password@ucsf.edu).

Otherwise, you'll need to unlock your account via ServiceNow.
Do not send an email to Wynton support - they can only
unlock your account if you have created a ServiceNow ticket.

Instructions:

1. Go to the [Wynton Account Request/Wynton Account Modification]
   ServiceNow form  
   (_Login to ServiceNow requires UCSF MyAccess credentials. If you do
   not have access, your faculty sponsor, or another approved
   representative, will need to fill out this form for you_)

2. Under 'Account Details', choose **'Yes'** for _"Does this user
   already have an existing account on Wynton?"_

3. Fill out the remaining required fields

4. Submit the form

The Wynton Support Team will get notified and take action on it on a
daily basis.


_Footnotes_:

[^1] If you did not receive such a message, please let support know, so
that we can investigate. The messages are titled '[Wynton] Your Wynton
password is expiring' and are sent from `do-not-reply@wynton.ucsf.edu` to
the email address that is associated with your Wynton account.
