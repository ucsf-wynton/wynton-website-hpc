#### <span style="color: orange;">Sporadic job failure</span>

**Update**: There was another burst of "can't get password entry for
user" errors starting on 2025-01-26 around 15:30, causing jobs to fail
immediately. We are restarting the SSSD service on the ~140 compute
nodes we have identified suffer from this problem.  <br><span
class="timestamp">January 27, 11:45 PT</span>

**Update**: To lower the risk for this problem to occur, the SSSD
timeout limit was increased from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
<br><span class="timestamp">November 20, 2023, 10:00 PT</span>

**Update**: The "can't get password entry for user" error happens on
some compute nodes where the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD)
has failed.  Until the cause for failed SSSD has been identified and
resolved, the only solution is to resubmit the job.
<br><span class="timestamp">November 17, 2023, 09:30 PT</span>

**Notice**: Some jobs end up in an error state (Eqw) with an error
"can't get password entry for user "alice". Either user does not exist
or error with NIS/LDAP etc."
