# Log in without Password

These instructions explains how to set up your local computer such that you can log into the compute cluster, or copy files to and from the cluster, without having to enter your password each time.


## Instruction

In summary, the steps are:

1. On your local computer: Generate private-public key pair
2. On the cluster: Add public key
3. On your local computer: Verify password-free access
4. On your local computer: Edit `~/.ssh/config` for setting default SSH options per remote host/server

Expected time: < 10 minutes.

These instructions are for the `ssh` client available on Linux, macOS, and MS Windows.  If you use the [PuTTY] SSH client, the overall idea is similar. Please consult the PuTTY user forums for further instructions.

### Step 1: Generate private-public SSH key pair (on local machine)

Here, we will generate a private-public SSH key pair (stored in two files) that is unique for accessing the cluster:

```sh
{local}$ mkdir ~/.ssh
{local}$ chmod u=rwx,go= ~/.ssh
{local}$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Created directory '/home/alice/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/alice/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}
Your public key has been saved in /home/alice/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub.
he key fingerprint is:
SHA256:2MpJL+I6rQbfhvLZAyC6fa6Y40yZhwG+FYOiHCQ94Fw alice@my_laptop
The key\'s randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|o+ E             |
|= =              |
|o= +             |
|O . o  o         |
|+= .  o S        |
|o O  o +         |
| @ *. = .        |
|*oB+*. .         |
|+B*O+.           |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
If you specify a passphrase, your local operating system will ask for the passphrase _the first time_ you try to log in to the cluster.  All other login attempts will be passphrase (and password) free (until you reboot the machine).  This should work out of the box on macOS and most Linux distributions - on MS Windows you need to set up your SSH agent manually (or use an empty passphrase).  If you choose to use an empty passphrase, make sure that your machine is safe and uses a highly secure local login password.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
<span>ðŸ›‘</span> The public key you can safely share with the world, but **treat your _private key_ as a password; anyone who has access to it will have access to your account if it does not have a passphrase!**
</div>


## Step 2: Add the public SSH key (on cluster)

Next, we will set up the cluster to recognize your public SSH key.  Assuming your cluster user name is `alice` in the cluster, the goal is to append the content of the _public_ key file to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the cluster.  There are two ways this can be done.

**Alternative 1**: If you have the `ssh-copy-id` tool installed on your local computer, then use:

```sh
{local}$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "{{ site.user.home }}/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}:s password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

{local}$ 
```

Done.



**Alternative 2**: If you don't have `ssh-copy-id`, you will have to copy the _public_ key file over to the cluster, log in, append it to the target file, and validate file permissions.  Assuming you already have a `~/.ssh` folder on the cluster, first copy the public key file to `~/.ssh` on the cluster:

```sh
{local}$ scp ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}:.ssh/
laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub           100%  390     0.4KB/s   00:00
```

Then, log into the cluster (still using a password) and _append_ the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```sh
{local}$ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=keyboard-interactive,password alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}
alice1@{{ site.login.ip }}\'s password: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} ~]$ cd .ssh
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} .ssh]$ cat laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}.pub >> authorized_keys
```

Finally, make sure that `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on {{ site.cluster.nickname }} is only accessible to you (otherwise that file will be completely ignored by SSH);

```sh
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} .ssh]$ chmod u=rw,go= ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} .ssh]$ stat --format=%A ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw-------
```

Lastly, log out from the cluster:

```sh
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} .ssh]$ exit
{local}$ 
```

Done.


## Step 3: Test

You should now be able to log into the cluster from your local computer without having to enter the cluster password.  Try the following:

```sh
{local}$ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey,keyboard-interactive -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }} alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} ~]$ 
```

You will be asked to enter your _passphrase_, if you chose one above.

If you get

```sh
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive,password).
```

then make sure you use the correct user name and that the file permissions on `~/.ssh` are correct on your _local_ machine.  See Appendix Section '[Fix non-secure file permission on ~/.ssh/]' for instructions.  If it still does not work, check the `~/.ssh` permissions on the cluster too.

The reason why we use `-o PreferredAuthentications=publickey,keyboard-interactive -o IdentitiesOnly=yes` in the above test, is so that we can make sure no alternative login mechanisms than our SSH keypair are in play.  After having validated the above, these options can be dropped and you can now use:

```sh
{local}$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }} alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} ~]$ 
```


## Step 4: Avoid having to specify SSH option `-i` (on local machine)

It is rather tedious having to specify what private key file to use
(`-i ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}`) each
time you use SSH.  As a last step, we will set the default options for
`alice@{{ site.login.hostname }}`.  On your local machine, add the
following directive to `~/.ssh/config` (if you don't have the file, create
it):

```lang-none
Host *.{{ site.cluster.domain }}
  User alice
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}
```

With all of the above, you should now be able to log in to the cluster
using:

```sh
{local}$ ssh {{ site.login.hostname }}
[alice@{{ site.login.name }} ~]$ 
```

Because we use globbing for `Host` in the above SSH config directive, it
applies to SSH connections for _all_ {{ site.cluster.nickname }}
connections.


## Appendix

### Fix non-secure file permission on ~/.ssh/

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
These instructions are only for Linux and macOS.
</div>

_On your local machine_, open a terminal, and run

```sh
{local}$ stat --format=%A ~/.ssh
drwx------
```

The `stat` output consists of four parts: `d` tells us it is a directory, `rw-` specifies the permission for the user (`u`), and the following `---` and `---` specifies the permissions for the group (`g`), and all others (`o`), respectively.

If the reported permission for group and others are anything but `---`, then `scp` and `ssh` don't trust the folder and will silently ignore your SSH key pair.  To secure the folder, do:

```sh
{local}$ chmod u=rwx,go= ~/.ssh
{local}$ stat --format=%A ~/.ssh
drwx------
```

_Explanation:_ The above `chmod` settings specify that you as a user (`u`) have read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions for this directory.  In addition, you have executable (`x`) permission, which also means you can set it as your working directory.  Continuing, the settings also specify that other users in your group (`g`) as well as all other (`o`) users on the system have no access at all (empty permission).


### Automatically connect with X11 Forwarding

If you often use `ssh -X` when connecting to the cluster, that is, you
often use X11 Forwarding for remote graphics etc., then you can make
this the default by adding `ForwardX11 yes` to the above 
`Host *.{{ site.cluster.domain }}` in `~/.ssh/config` on your 
local computer:

```lang-none
Host *.{{ site.cluster.domain }}
  User alice
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/laptop_to_{{ site.cluster.nickname | downcase }}
  ForwardX11 yes
  Compression yes
```

We also add `Compression yes`, which corresponds to `ssh -C`, to
[improve the X11 Forwarding performance].

If you use `ssh -Y`, which you might have to do if you are on macOS,
then add also `ForwardX11Trusted yes`:

```lang-none
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  Compression yes
```


### Connect directly to a development node

The login nodes should only be used for light-weight tasks such as
submitting job scripts, checking that the status of existing jobs, and
doing basic file manipulations.  We should do all other type of tasks
on development nodes, do avoid risk clogging up the login nodes.  To
avoid having to do two manual SSH steps, one to a login node followed
immediately by one to the development, we can set up another SSH
configuration directive that does both in one SSH call.

First, make sure you have created the above 
`Host: *.{{ site.cluster.domain }}` directive in `~/.ssh/config`
on your local computer and verified that it  works.  Then, append
another directive with:

```lang-none
Host *dev?.{{ site.cluster.domain }}
  ProxyJump {{ site.login.hostname }}
```

These two directives together will allow you to connect directly to a
development host from your local machine, e.g.

```sh
{local}$ ssh {{ site.devel.name }}.{{ site.cluster.domain }}
[alice@{{ site.devel.name }} ~]$ 
```

This works, because the `ProxyJump` specification makes the SSH
connection use `{{ site.login.hostname }}` as a "jump host" and from
there automatically continue to the requested development host.  The
result of this latter SSH configuration directive is the same as if you would
have called `ssh -J {{ site.login.hostname }} {{ site.devel.name }}.{{ site.cluster.domain }}`.
