Wynton Protected, which is a subset of the Wynton HPC environment, is
**not** approved for storing and working with P4/Protected Health
Information (PHI) data. **Existing Wynton Protected users may only use
P3 data, but should take immediate action to remove P3 data
from Wynton by {{ site.data.specs.protected_eol }}.**  For UCSF’s determination of the
Protection Levels (P1, P2, P3, P4), refer to [UCSF Policy 650-16
Addendum F - UCSF Data Classification
Standard](https://it.ucsf.edu/standard-guideline/ucsf-policy-650-16-addendum-f-ucsf-data-classification-standard).
