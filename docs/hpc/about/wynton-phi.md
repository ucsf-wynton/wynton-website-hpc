# Wynton Protected

Wynton Protected, which is a subset of the Wynton HPC environment, is **not** approved for storing and working with P4/Protected Health Information (PHI) data. Wynton Protected should be used for P3 data. For UCSFâ€™s determination of the Protection Levels (P1, P2, P3, P4), refer to [UCSF Policy 650-16 Addendum F - UCSF Data Classification Standard](https://it.ucsf.edu/standard-guideline/ucsf-policy-650-16-addendum-f-ucsf-data-classification-standard).

## Getting a Wynton Protected account

To apply for a new Wynton HPC account with access to Wynton Protected, or to modify an existing account to Wynton Protected, please follow the [instructions for requesting or updating an account](/hpc/about/join.html). This will initiate an automated onboarding process to check that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Valid email address

* PI approval to work on Wynton Protected

* Signed attestation to the UCSF Statement of Responsibility

Once these are completed, you will be notified of your account credentials to access Wynton Wynton. If you already have a regular Wynton HPC account, your account will be reconfigured to access Wynton Protected.


## Other options at UCSF to work with PHI data

Depending on your project, Wynton Protected may or may not be the best fit for your P3 project. We encourage you to also evaluate the following alternatives at UCSF that are approved for both P3 and P4/PHI data:

* [UCSF Research Analysis Environment (RAE)](https://it.ucsf.edu/service/rae)
* [UCSF Data Center Services](https://it.ucsf.edu/service/data-center-services)
* [UCSF Central IT Cloud Services](https://cloudservices.ucsf.edu/)
