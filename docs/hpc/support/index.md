## Checklist when asking for help

Whenever asking for help, here or elsewhere, think "How can I help
the helper help me?"  

Below is a checklist that helps us better assist you with your issue
and get to a resolution sooner. Please make sure to:

  * [ ] &nbsp; include your username on the cluster (e.g. "My user
        name is `alice`.").
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; specify what machine the problem occurs on (e.g. "I
        tried this on `dev1` and `dev3`.").

  * [ ] &nbsp; for failing jobs, specify the job ID of the job that
        has issues (e.g. "Jobs that failed are `9702394` and
        `9709933`, but it worked for `9704439`.").

  * [ ] &nbsp; for failing jobs, specify how you submit the job and
        what your script is (e.g. "I submit using `qsub -cwd -j y -l
        mem_free=500M my_script.sh`. My script is
        `/wynton/home/boblab/alice/my_script.sh`.").

  * [ ] &nbsp; cut-and-paste text from the console.  If using Slack,
        please format your output as a "Code Block" (there's a button
        for it too); it makes it much easier to read.  [Avoid
        screenshot
        images](/hpc/support/faq.html#avoid-screenshots-when-asking-for-help).
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; use 'Reply All' in all your email correspondence. That
        way others in the team can pitch with additional knowledge and
        suggestions.
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; never include PHI, or other sensitive, data in
        unencrypted emails or Slack channels. If you need to include
        sensitive data, use the UCSF encrypted email system (invoke by
        including "Secure:" at the start of the email subject line.)
        Do not include sensitive data in your Slack posts.
