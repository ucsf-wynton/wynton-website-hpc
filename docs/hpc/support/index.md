## Checklist when asking for help

Whenever asking for help, here or elsewhere, stop, take a big breathe, and then ask yourself:

ðŸ‘‰ **_- "How can I help the helper help me?"_** ðŸ‘ˆ

Below is a checklist that helps us better assist you with your issue
and get to a resolution sooner. Please make sure to:

  * [ ] &nbsp; include your username on the cluster (e.g. "My user
        name is `alice`.").
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; specify what machine the problem occurs on (e.g. "I
        tried this on `dev1` and `dev3`.").

  * [ ] &nbsp; if you get an error, cut-and-paste the full error
        message (e.g. `R: command not found`).

  * [ ] &nbsp; for failing jobs, specify the job ID of the job that
        has issues (e.g. "Jobs that failed are `9702394` and
        `9709933`, but it worked for `9704439`.").

  * [ ] &nbsp; for failing jobs, specify how you submit the job and
        what your script is (e.g. "I submit using `qsub -cwd -j y -l
        mem_free=500M my_script.sh`. My script is
        `/wynton/home/boblab/alice/my_script.sh`.").  If the script is
        not too long, consider pasting it in your message.

  * [ ] &nbsp; cut-and-paste text from the console. By including also
        the prompt (e.g. `[alice@{{ site.devel.name }} ~]$ somecmd
        input.txt`), you convey useful information, such as your
        username, current machine, and current working directory, and
        possibly more.
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; if using Slack, please format code and output as a "Code
        Block" (there's a button for it too); it makes it much easier
        to read.  [Avoid screenshot
        images](/hpc/support/faq.html#avoid-screenshots-when-asking-for-help).
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; use 'Reply All' in all your email correspondence. That
        way others in the team can pitch with additional knowledge and
        suggestions.
  
  * [ ] &nbsp; never include protected health information (PHI), or
        other sensitive, data in unencrypted emails or Slack
        channels. If you need to include sensitive data, use the UCSF
        encrypted email system (invoke by including "Secure:" at the
        start of the email subject line.)  Do not include sensitive
        data in your Slack posts.
