### Ubuntu 20.04 (Legacy Notes)

_2023-02-08: These installation notes are probably out dated by now._

_Warning_: It turns out that [the most recent version of Jekyll is not compatible with the recent version of GitHub Pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/577).  Specifically, GitHub Pages requires Jekyll version >= 3.7.3 and < 4.0.0 - the latest version verified to work is Jekyll 3.8.7.  So we need to make sure to install specific version of a few packages below.

The below instructions assumes that Ruby and its `gem` command is available on the machine.  Other than that, making sure to use option `--user-install` when installing, you should be able install Jekyll to your personal account without admin rights.

```sh
$ gem install --user-install bundler jekyll:3.8.7 listen:3.1.5 liquid:4.0.0 github-pages:204
